# Using Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) to Process Movie Ratings Data

Amazing Prime needs a dataset for their hackathon from which people will make predictions for which low-budget movies will be successful so Amazing Prime can buy the streaming rights. We created the necessary clean datasets for this purpose. The datasources are a scrape of Wikipedia with movie data releases and rating data from MovieLens. We transformed the datasets into clean datasets and loaded them in SQL data tables. Cleaning the data required removing duplicates, removing unnecessary columns, using Regex to standardize columns containing dollar amounts (budget, box office) and dates (release date).
